# T.I.M.O.T.H.Y

Welcome T.I.M.O.T.H.Y - or: "this is my oppurtunity to hear you" - my liri app!

"T.I.M.O.T.H.Y" is an app developed by me, the starry eyed romantic formerly (and currently) reffered to as Alex. 

The goal of this app is to make AJAX calls to three seperate databases so users can search and pull data for their own purposes (no judgement).

Nothing here is "R" rated inherently, but nor is there any filter and as we all know when searching content on the web sometimes results can come unexpectedly. Users are advised to excercise discretion when searching.

To start you can tell "T.I.M.O.T.H.Y" to do one of four commands:

1. **concert** - This will search an artist to see upcoming tour date(s). *Example: concert Drake*
1. **spotify** - This will search a song title on spotify and provide you with some info on the track as well as a link to it on spotify. *Example: spotify Lithium*
1. **omdb** - This will search a movie by title and give you some info on it. *Example: omdb Goonies*
1. **dowhatsay** - This will take whatever is written in the *random.txt* file and use it to execute one of the previous three commands. *Example: spotify-this-song,"lithium"*

>**Please Note:** Commands *must* be executed in a format mirroring their respective examples in order to function properly.

If you need any assistance or have any questions hopefully there's a concert, song or movie that might be able to help you out.

Happy searchings!
